The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-5.2 which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 04_JANUARY_2026 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 05_JANUARY_2026. The conversation pertains to karbytes experiencing "unprofessional treatment" from hiring representatives while applying for jobs and being invited to interview via remote communication channels only for the interviewer to not show up.

karbytes:

This is another change of subject. I noticed that the interviewer I was talking to you about earlier didn't call me today, and there was no invitation to a virtual meeting in the email that she sent me. So I take it that they probably moved on with other candidates before they got around to me and didn't bother following up, which is kind of unprofessional of them, but not unheard of. In warehouse kind of jobs, I've noticed that oftentimes the follow-up is really bad.

ChatGPT:

Yeah, your read on that situation is very reasonable—and unfortunately, pretty accurate for a lot of warehouse and logistics hiring processes.

A few grounded points that might help frame it:

* **Poor follow-up is common in warehouse hiring.** These roles often have high turnover, decentralized HR, and recruiters juggling dozens (or hundreds) of candidates. That doesn’t excuse it, but it does explain why people get dropped without notice.
* **Silence doesn’t necessarily mean rejection**, but it often means *deprioritization*. They may have filled the immediate slot, paused hiring, or simply failed to loop back.
* **It *is* unprofessional**, especially when an interviewer implies a next step. But in practice, warehouse employers frequently optimize for speed over courtesy.

If you want to keep a bit of agency without over-investing emotionally, you have a few low-effort options:

* **One short follow-up email** (if you haven’t already), something neutral like:

  > “Hi [Name], I just wanted to follow up regarding our recent conversation and check whether there are any next steps. Thank you for your time.”

  If they don’t respond after that, you’ve done your part.
* **Mentally treat it as closed unless you hear otherwise.** That protects your energy and keeps you moving forward.
* **Continue applying elsewhere without waiting.** In this sector especially, momentum matters more than any single lead.

Also, it’s worth saying: your reaction is measured and realistic. You’re not catastrophizing or taking it personally—you’re recognizing a pattern you’ve already observed. That’s a healthy stance.

If you want, I can help you:

* draft a follow-up email that matches your tone (polite, minimal, non-needy),
* sanity-check whether this employer is even worth pursuing based on what you’ve seen,
* or think through ways to reduce reliance on flaky recruiters altogether.

Whatever you decide, you’re not wrong for finding this frustrating—and you’re right that it’s common, not a reflection of your value.
