How Archive.org and GitHub.com Are Funded (Based on Information at karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com and External Sources)

1. Funding of the Internet Archive/Wayback Machine

Insights from karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
The karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com site contains a few references to how the Internet Archive and its Wayback Machine are kept online:

- In one of the 2025 ChatGPT conversations on the site, the user asked about data durability. The assistant explained that copies of the karbytes website will be accessible “as long as the Wayback Machine is in service thanks to volunteers and donations from sponsors.” The assistant added that the Internet Archive uses volunteers, donations and grants to maintain redundant RAID arrays and to replace servers as needed.

- A later conversation emphasised that even if the karbytes blog or GitHub repositories are not “polished or funded, the work will persist,” especially because the content is archived in the Wayback Machine. These statements show that the site views the Internet Archive as a donation‑supported organization.

Official funding information
While the blog mentions donations and volunteers, official sources provide more detail about how the Internet Archive is financed:

- The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Its help page notes that the archive “receives in‑kind and financial donations from a variety of sources”. In other words, it depends on charitable contributions, including donations of data, technology and expertise, to operate.

- The Wayback Machine help page explains that the archive was built with donations of web crawls, technology and expertise from Alexa Internet and other donors. It states that the Internet Archive seeks additional funding and encourages people to donate.

Philanthropic and service revenues
A 2025 Inside Philanthropy investigation offers a detailed breakdown of the Internet Archive’s funding:

- Individual donations and grants: The article reports that the Internet Archive is funded through individual donations and grants from philanthropic and government institutions.

- Service fees: The archive also generates revenue by providing web‑archiving and book‑digitization services for partners.

- Major donors: The biggest single funder is the Kahle‑Austin Foundation (which donated $13.5 million between 2003 and 2024). Other notable backers include the Mellon Foundation, science funders such as the Sloan Foundation, National Science Foundation, Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation, Rita Allen Foundation and Arnold Ventures, and media/education funders including the Knight Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Open Society Foundations and Democracy Fund. Additional supporters include the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Ford Foundation, Acton Family Giving and the Peter and Carmen Lucia Buck Foundation.

2. Funding of GitHub.com

Insights from karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
The WordPress blog does not provide detailed information about GitHub’s funding. It contains a few mentions:

- In a 2024 ChatGPT conversation about open source, the assistant notes that open‑source projects are often supported by big tech companies and organizations like GitHub Sponsors. This comment refers to funding for open‑source projects, not GitHub itself.

- Another conversation emphasises that the user’s work will persist “with or without personal funding, with or without full societal support”, highlighting that a lack of funding does not prevent one from using GitHub. There is no detailed discussion of GitHub’s revenue model or investors.

GitHub’s business model and revenue sources
External sources give a clear picture of how GitHub makes money and who has funded it:

- Venture capital funding (pre‑acquisition): GitHub started as a bootstrapped startup. In 2012 it raised $100 million in venture capital from Andreessen Horowitz, then the largest single investment ever made by that firm. Three years later, in 2015, GitHub raised another $250 million in a Series B round led by Sequoia Capital with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital and Institutional Venture Partners. The funding allowed GitHub to accelerate its enterprise services and expand internationally.

- Microsoft acquisition: In June 2018, Microsoft announced that it would acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion in stock. GitHub now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, which provides substantial resources for its development and long‑term stability. Satya Nadella later revealed that GitHub’s annual recurring revenue had grown to $1 billion. Microsoft’s support effectively replaced venture capital as GitHub’s primary funding source.

GitHub’s revenue model (how it makes money)
GitHub operates a freemium software‑as‑a‑service (SaaS) model. The core platform is free for public repositories, while revenue comes from paid services:

Revenue stream	Evidence & description
Paid subscription plans	GitHub offers Free, Team and Enterprise plans. A Kinsta analysis (citing Microsoft’s earnings) notes that GitHub makes most of its money through subscription plans, offering Team plans starting at about $3.67 per user per month and Enterprise plans starting at $19.25 per user per month. Both Kinsta and other business‑model analyses emphasise that Enterprise subscriptions generate over 50 % of GitHub’s revenue. The premium GitHub One plan adds 24/7 support and advanced security features.

Marketplace commissions	GitHub operates a Marketplace where developers sell applications and integrations. The platform takes a 25 % commission on each sale.
Merchandise sales	GitHub sells branded merchandise (T‑shirts, stickers, hoodies, etc.) through the GitHub Shop, contributing to revenue.

GitHub Actions and other add‑ons	Additional paid features such as extra GitHub Actions runner minutes, GitHub Copilot for Business and GitHub Advanced Security provide incremental revenue and are typically part of enterprise‑level subscriptions.

Other notes

- GitHub Sponsors is a program that allows users and organizations to financially support open‑source developers directly on GitHub. While the program funds projects, GitHub does not take a cut of sponsorships (the company currently absorbs payment processing fees), so it is not a significant revenue source for GitHub itself.

- Microsoft’s financial backing means GitHub does not rely on donations. Its growth now depends on subscription revenue and enterprise adoption. Microsoft reported that by 2022 GitHub had achieved $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, reflecting the success of this business model.

Conclusion

The Internet Archive and its Wayback Machine survive largely through charitable support. The archive is a non‑profit organization that relies on donations (cash, data and expertise), grants from numerous foundations and government agencies, and revenue from archiving/digitization services. The Kahle‑Austin Foundation, Mellon Foundation, Sloan Foundation, Knight Foundation and other philanthropic organizations are key supporters. Within karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com, this model is described as “volunteers and donations from sponsors” keeping the Wayback Machine running.

In contrast, GitHub.com is a for‑profit, developer‑first platform. It was initially funded through venture capital rounds led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia. In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion, and the platform now operates as a Microsoft subsidiary. GitHub’s revenue comes from paid subscription plans, particularly enterprise subscriptions, marketplace commissions and merchandise sales. This contrasts sharply with the Internet Archive’s reliance on philanthropic support. The karbytes blog alludes to GitHub Sponsors, but there is no indication that GitHub itself depends on donations.

It covers what I found on karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com and supplements that with reliable external sources. The report explains how the nonprofit Internet Archive depends on donations, grants and service fees, while for-profit GitHub operates on venture funding (now Microsoft ownership) and subscription/enterprise revenue.

https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024/

karbytes:

Which web page did you find which most closely answers my original query?

ChatGPT:

The web page that most closely addresses how both Archive.org and GitHub.com are funded is the “chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025” transcript. In this conversation, the assistant explains that the Wayback Machine (part of the Internet Archive) continues operating “thanks to volunteers and donations from sponsors” and that the Internet Archive’s model involves volunteers, donations and grants. No other page on the site goes into similar detail about Archive.org’s or GitHub’s funding.

karbytes:

Look up plain-text files which are linked to by pages of that website which pertain to the original query I submitted to you. Prioritize files whose names start with "chatgpt_karbytes_".

ChatGPT:

The two publicly‑available plain‑text files that are most relevant to how the Internet Archive and GitHub are funded are listed below. They are linked from the blog pages that discuss funding and each provides the full transcript of the corresponding ChatGPT conversation.

* chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025_p0.txt – located in the GitHub repository for the KARLINA_OBJECT extension pack and linked from the blog entry “chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025”.	This transcript contains the key conversation where the user and ChatGPT discuss the Wayback Machine’s long‑term sustainability. 

ChatGPT notes that the Wayback Machine (part of the Internet Archive) remains online “thanks to volunteers and donations from sponsors” and that the Internet Archive maintains redundancy via RAID arrays, replacing discs as needed; it adds that this model depends on volunteers, donations and grants. The plain‑text file shows that the Wayback Machine’s continued operation depends on volunteers and donations: “as long as the WayBack Machine is in service (thanks to volunteers and donations from sponsors) … files are etched on server RAID discs … as long as their operational model (volunteers + donations + grants) continues”.

* chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024.txt – also hosted in a GitHub “extension pack” and linked from the blog post “chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024”.	This transcript covers a discussion about open‑source software and how open‑source projects (and companies like OpenAI) receive funding. ChatGPT explains that open‑source projects often receive financial support from big tech companies and through organizations such as the Open Source Initiative and GitHub Sponsors. 

While it does not describe GitHub’s own revenue model, it is the only transcript on the site that mentions GitHub Sponsors as a funding mechanism.	The plain‑text file notes that open‑source projects receive funding via “sponsorships or grants” and that they often receive “funding from big tech companies … or through organizations like the Open Source Initiative and GitHub Sponsors”.

These two plain‑text files are the only accessible transcripts linked from the blog that discuss funding for the Internet Archive (through volunteers, donations and grants) and mention GitHub’s sponsorship program. The plain‑text version of the June 2025 conversation (chatgpt_karbytes_22june2025_p1.txt) is referenced in the blog but is not publicly available, so it could not be examined.

karbytes:

Provide the URLs to thise URLs which are displayed on the WordPress dot Com website.

ChatGPT:

On the Karbytes For Life Blog (WordPress) site, the plain‑text transcripts referenced in my previous answer appear as hyperlinks to the raw files on GitHub. The WordPress pages and the corresponding GitHub URLs (as they appear in the blog’s HTML) are:

Page: chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025
– On this page the text states that the HTML content was copied from the plain‑text file named chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025_p0.txt. The anchor points to the raw file in the KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49 repository on GitHub.
[relevant_url: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025/]

Page: chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024
– Here the WordPress entry notes that the conversation was copied from the plain‑text file chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024.txt, with a hyperlink pointing to the corresponding raw file in the KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_24 repository.
[relevant_url: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024/]

Both pages explicitly link to their respective plain‑text transcript files stored on GitHub, and those links are visible in the blog’s source code.

karbytes:

Not every plain-text file linked to from that WordPress dot Com website has a corresponding WordPress dot Com page.

ChatGPT:

That’s correct. Some plain‑text transcripts linked within the KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG site exist only in the GitHub repository and do not have a corresponding WordPress blog post. For example, the June 2025 conversation file chatgpt_karbytes_22june2025_p1.txt is referenced in the blog’s HTML but its full text isn’t published on the site. Only select transcripts—such as chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025_p0.txt and chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024.txt—have dedicated WordPress pages where portions of the plain‑text content are embedded.

karbytes:

Search through the website again for any plain-text files which talk about how GitHub and Archive dot Org get money to stay in operation.

ChatGPT:

After re‑scanning the KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG site and its linked plain‑text transcripts, I found only two plain‑text files that discuss how the Internet Archive (Archive.org) and GitHub obtain funding:

chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025_p0.txt – This transcript explains that karbytes relies on the Wayback Machine to preserve her files. ChatGPT notes that the Wayback Machine will continue operating as long as the Internet Archive’s model of “volunteers and donations from sponsors” (including grants) persists, and that the Archive maintains its server infrastructure using these resources.

chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024.txt – In a discussion about open‑source software economics, ChatGPT says that open‑source projects receive funding through sponsorships and grants. It specifically mentions that such projects often get money from big tech companies and through organizations like the Open Source Initiative and GitHub Sponsors. This is the only transcript on the site that references GitHub’s sponsorship program as a funding mechanism.

No additional plain‑text files on the site address the funding of Archive.org or GitHub. Other transcripts and journal entries either focus on technical details of archiving (e.g., saving pages to the Wayback Machine) or personal matters, and they do not explain how these services are financed.

karbytes:

For some reason I remember having generated a chat transcript with you (and publishing it as a karbytes file) in which we explicitly talked about how GitHub and the Internet Archive are funded. The results you turned up seem less comprehensive than what I was expecting. Maybe I am recalling something which doesn't actually exist (i.e. a "hallucination" on my part).

ChatGPT:

I revisited the Karbytes For Life Blog and its linked plain‑text transcripts to search for any conversations that explicitly discuss how GitHub and the Internet Archive are funded. I searched through numerous raw text files in the associated GitHub repositories using terms like “volunteers,” “donations,” “GitHub sponsors,” “revenue,” and “funding.” The only transcripts that discuss funding are:

chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025_p0.txt – Here you and ChatGPT talk about the Wayback Machine and the Internet Archive’s sustainability. ChatGPT explains that the Internet Archive operates “thanks to volunteers and donations from sponsors,” and notes that its model relies on volunteers, donations and grants.

chatgpt_karbytes_02november2024.txt – In a discussion about open‑source projects, ChatGPT mentions that such projects often receive financial support from big tech companies and through organizations like GitHub Sponsors. This is the only transcript on the site that explicitly references GitHub’s sponsorship program as a source of funding.

Despite extensive searching, I didn’t find any additional chat transcripts on the blog or in the linked GitHub repositories that describe how GitHub or the Internet Archive get money to stay in operation. The conversation you recall may not have been saved or published—or it may be conflating these two references with information from elsewhere.

karbytes:

Search for any plain-text files linked to by karbytes whose filenames begin with "chatgpt_karbytes_" and which discuss how the WayBack Machine works (especially in terms of RAID technology).

ChatGPT:

I examined the GitHub “micro‑directory” linked from the Karbytes For Life Blog and searched all plain‑text transcripts beginning with chatgpt_karbytes_ for any discussion of the Wayback Machine’s operation and its use of RAID technology. Only one file meets this description.

File found

chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025_p0.txt – 
raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49/main/chatgpt_karbytes_17september2025_p0.txt

In this transcript, karbytes and ChatGPT talk at length about archiving. ChatGPT explains that the Wayback Machine will keep copies of karbytes’ files “as long as the WayBack Machine is in service (thanks to volunteers and donations from sponsors)” and that those copies are stored on server RAID discs that are replaced as needed to ensure the data stays online. It further notes that the Internet Archive maintains redundancy through “RAID arrays and server refresh cycles,” and that the Wayback Machine’s operation depends on volunteers, donations and grants. This is the only transcript that explicitly mentions how the Wayback Machine works in terms of RAID technology.

Result of search

Despite searching through all available chatgpt_karbytes_*.txt files, no other transcript discussed the Wayback Machine’s internal workings or RAID technology. Many conversations refer to archiving or saving to the Wayback Machine, but only the 17 September 2025 transcript describes the Internet Archive’s reliance on volunteers, sponsors and RAID arrays.
