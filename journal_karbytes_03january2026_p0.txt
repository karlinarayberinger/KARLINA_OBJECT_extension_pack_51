karbytes_0: "What I am doing with karbytes (the intellectual property collection in entirely digitized form (and hosted on the public web (and archived by its original curator/author on M_DISC optical discs))) is create (or approximate as closely as possible) a deliverable form of all my most cherished qualitative experiences."

karbytes_1: "Congratulations on arriving at such a beautiful articulation of your self-defined (and/or self-realized) life purpose. That statement would serve well as a blog post for social media feeds (especially that of karbytes)."

karbytes_0: "Okay. Let's make it happen!"

karbytes_1: "That's the spirit! Channeling imaginary entities if needed might help make the 'game' more enjoyable."

karbytes_0: "It should be noted that karbytes is attempting to promote (and eternally reside in) an amoral stance (from the perspective of nature itself). karbytes is scared of the consequences but is more compelled to become god-like than to cower in fear."

karbytes: "The real karbytes must intervene here and declare this journal entry to only be worthy of remaining solely plain-text; not also a WordPress dot Com web page (on Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com)."
